# Homework 2 Portfolio
Create a Portfolio from scratch

## Acceptance Criteria


```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

### Screenshots

Notes:

Nav
- Nav Bar is a Navy-greenish colour with light teal writing and box.
- Box on left hand side has no left margin. Enter Name here
- Nav elements are underlined.
- There is a Resume link here. We can either make a button at the bottom to say download resume, or we can do that in the link. Lets do second option as that makes more sense for this.
- About Me, Work, Contact Me, Resume

Hero
- photo taking up full length.
- teal box again with margins saying cool subtitle. Here we can put the job the person is after.
- in the criteria it says to have a recent photo. I think the image size here is too slim. Otherwise there will be a small photo of the person and a lot of space around the person. Either we make it bigger or we add a photo in the about me section.

About me
- We have the heading in the side bar. Line dividing heading and content. 
- we could add the photo here, when you hover over it it could say 'about me'

Work
- Once again, side bar has heading work.
- Right hand-side has images relating to the work.
- Each photo has a border around it with a box at the bottom left-side corner. 
- Tinge of teal
- When you hover over, the photo becomes clear.
- One large photo, 4 small ones.

![Mock-up-End](Assets\images\Mock-up-3.PNG)

Contact Me
- Heading in sidebar with line in the middle
- Phone number, email, Github, Twitter, Spotify

Footer
- In the mock up provided, we see no footer.
- perhaps we will add one in to complete the page.

## My sketch

Will Load this soon.


## Start

I have created my index.html and style.css. For fun, I have chosen a different name (Sorry Learnatino, hard lesson to learn). Michael Collins, even though he is currently retired, is wanting to have a side hobby of being a web developer. Good on you, Mike!

I have made my basic html page by writing '!' then enter. I have linked my stylesheet and changed the title of the web page to Mike Collins - Web Developer.

I will just make the skeleton up, starting with the nav bar. Quickly, I know ideally you are meant to do mobile layout first. But because we have a desktop layout, I will make this first.

In my CSS, i have used the root element to create my colour theme for the page.
